## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

During this challenge I was able to learn a little more about the basics of HTML and CSS

### Continued development

For the future, the idea is to prioritize the understanding of Grid and Flexbox.
In addition to exploring the possibilities that CSS provides in code development.

### Useful resources
